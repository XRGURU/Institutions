# Market Place

You can access AR/VR digital material on your device through the Marketplace. While some content is available for free, you will need to purchase packages from our Marketplace. In the marketplace, individual customers can purchase a package.

When you click on a package, such as Basic Biology, you will be sent to a detail page in which you can see all of the topics. You can browse the topics and make purchases accordingly.
