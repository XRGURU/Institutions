## How to create teachers
 
Once you're on the teachers tab, you can begin creating teachers by assigning licences to appropriate instructors depending on the packages and licences you purchased.
As an example, granting a biology licence to a biology teacher.

For creating a teacher, you must provide your first name, last name, and email address. After you create a teacher, you will receive an email with their login information. Even teachers must update their passwords for the first time while logging in.
